# Smaller-Units
A rewrite of little blocks

[**View it on the curseforge page!**](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smaller-units)

# Info
I should probably note that I did not use code from the original mod

I have no plans to backport to anything from 1.12.2 or lower, but I might do a rewrite of the 1.12 version, as there’s still a ton of mods that have not ported and I had made a bad version of su there

Also, I am disappointed by how few people seem to know about the original little blocks mod.

# Fact And Question: 

(Questions I see people asking)

**Will this be better than little blocks?**

Maybe.

**Can I use this in my modpacks?**

Yes, that is why I post mods to CurseForge.  
Be cautious with it however.

**Is there somewhere I can talk to the dev(s) in realtime?**

Yes, [here’s my modding Discord.](https://discord.gg/qFEBSsm)

**Why not just wait for someone else to port it or let slimevoid do it themselves?**

A) I realized nobody else was gonna port it

B) Slimevoid seems to have fallen appart

**Is this survival ready?**

Yes.
